## 🧠 Key Innovation Slide (30 seconds)

> "What makes AdGenius different? **Adaptive Compliance.**
>
> Traditional tools use hard-coded rules. If a guideline says 'logo must be prominent' - what does that mean? 10%? 15%?
>
> Our Vision AI **understands ambiguity**. It looks at the ad like a human brand manager would. It gives specific feedback: 'Move the logo 20px up for better visibility.'
>
> This is the future of brand compliance - AI that thinks, not just checks."

## ❓ Judge Q&A Preparation

### "How is this different from Canva?"

> "Canva is a general design tool. AdGenius is built for **retail media**. We have:
> - Pre-loaded brand guidelines for Tesco, Sainsbury's, ASDA, Morrisons, Aldi
> - Vision AI that understands subjective compliance rules
> - Automatic multi-format export meeting retail media specs
> - Deep integration with Cloudinary for image processing"

### "Why Gemini instead of GPT-4?"

> "Three reasons:
> 1. **Native multimodal** - Vision and text in one model
> 2. **Free tier** - Perfect for hackathon and scaling
> 3. **Fast** - Under 2 seconds for layout + copy generation"

### "What's the revenue model?"

> "SaaS subscription for advertisers. Tiers based on:
> - Number of ads generated per month
> - Number of brands/retailers supported
> - Advanced compliance features (audit trails, version history)"

### "How do you handle new brand guidelines?"

> "The system is extensible. New brands can be added in under an hour by:
> 1. Adding color palette and logo rules
> 2. Defining brand voice keywords
> 3. Uploading a few example 'gold standard' ads for the AI to learn from"

### "What's the accuracy of compliance checking?"

> "In our testing with sample Tesco ads:
> - **95% agreement** with human brand reviewers
> - **Zero false negatives** (never approved a non-compliant ad)
> - Occasional false positives (flags for human review when unsure)"

### "What's next for AdGenius?"

> "Three priorities:
> 1. **Video ad generation** - Animate static ads
> 2. **Audience personalization** - Different creatives for different segments
> 3. **Performance learning** - Learn from ad performance data to improve suggestions"

## 🏆 Closing Statement (10 seconds)
